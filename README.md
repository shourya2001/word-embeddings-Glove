# Word Embeddings Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `Word_Embeddings.ipynb`, that explores the application of word embedding techniques for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides practical implementations for generating, analyzing, and utilizing word embeddings in various NLP workflows.

## Features
- **Word Embedding Generation**: Use pre-trained embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or train custom embeddings.
- **Visualization**: Techniques such as t-SNE or PCA for visualizing high-dimensional embeddings.
- **Similarity Analysis**: Evaluate semantic similarity and relationships between words.
- **Applications**: Utilize embeddings in downstream NLP tasks such as text classification, clustering, or sentiment analysis.
